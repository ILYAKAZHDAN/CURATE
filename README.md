# CURATE
CURATE is a tool that analyzes the unmapped read sequences in a FASTQ sample and aims to attribute them to specific biological contaminants, snythetic constructs and subjects, while expanding the reference genome.

## NOTE: Currently, CURATE is still under active development. Once the testing phase begins, we will publish the full repository.
